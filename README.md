# Vendor-Performance-Analysis
This project aims to analyze vendor and inventory performance for a retail/wholesale business using Power BI. The objective is to identify top-performing vendors, optimize inventory turnover, and recommend strategic actions to improve profitability and operational efficiency.

🎯 Business Objectives
--Identify underperforming brands requiring pricing or promotional adjustments
--Analyze top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit
--Assess bulk purchasing impact on unit cost savings
--Detect slow-moving inventory and optimize stock turnover
--Compare profit margins of high vs. low-performing vendors

🛠️ Tools Used
--Power BI – Dashboard creation & visualization
--Excel – Data cleaning and transformation
--Statistical Analysis – Hypothesis testing and correlation study

📌 Key Insights
--Bulk purchasing results in 72% lower unit costs, boosting profitability
--Top 10 vendors contribute over 65% of total purchases, indicating supply concentration risks
--$2.71M in unsold inventory identified, recommending clearance and optimization
--High-margin vendors struggle with volume; low-margin vendors succeed in sales

✅ Final Recommendations
* Promote low-volume, high-margin brands
* Diversify vendor base to reduce supply chain risk
* Use bulk ordering for cost efficiency
* Improve stock movement through better demand forecasting
* Adjust pricing and marketing strategies based on vendor performance
